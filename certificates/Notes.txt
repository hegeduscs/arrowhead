How to create Arrowhead-compliant certificates

0. Take the certificate keystore that is wished to be used as the signer

1. Open it in KeyStore Explorer (http://keystore-explorer.org/downloads.html)
  - default KeyStore and Key pwd-s for all test certificates: '12345'

2. Right click on the certificate itself --> Sign / Sign New Key Pair

3. Edit settings for the new certificate:
  - validity period: e.g. set to 10 years
  - Name --> There is a book icon with '@': set CN fields
    CN: <systemName>.<systemGroup>.<cloudName>.<operator>.arrowhead.eu format
    Other fields can be filled out arbitrarily.

4. Move the newly created certificate to a new tab within the app
  - drag & drop works
  - it creates a new jks file for it
  - 'Save as' this new keystore as a '.jks' file

5. Tools --> Set Keystore Password

6. Right click on the certificate --> Set Password
  - the 'old' password is empty
  - give a new password to the certificate itself

7. Tools --> Set Keystore Type --> JKS
  - this changes from 'p12' filetype to Java Keystore format

8. Save the keystore again (File --> Save or CTRL+S)

+1. Don't forget to delete the new certificate from the old one's keystore!
